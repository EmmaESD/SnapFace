# Snapface

It's a school project with OpenClassroom Tutorial. 

SnapFace is a one-week school project. The goal was to learn how to use Angular by selecting a tutorial and creating a project. I chose the Snap Face project from the OpenClassroom website.

SnapFace is a photo-sharing application.

On the home screen, there is the SnapFace logo with links redirecting to different pages, using the route method.

On the facesnap page, there is a list of photo posts with a form for publishing new photos. On each post preview, there is a link to view the entire post.

On the post page, we can see the posted image, and a button allows adding "snaps" or "likes."
